# C& compiled and interpreted practical programming language

Pronunciation: “**can-di**”(C.A.N.D.I.) or “**see-and**”(C&) 

# Goals 
- Quick and easy deployment of a minimum viable product with the ability to opt in to type and logic safety incrementally.   
- Plug and play on top of any C++ environment and call native methods from C&. #include “candi.h” is all you need.   

# Design Philosophies 
- “When there is a right way, there should be one choice. When there is no right way, there should be as many choices as possible.” 
- “If it can happen at compile time it should happen at compile time,  unless it must happen at run time.”
